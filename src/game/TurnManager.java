 * PURPOSE:
 * - Handles turn order (“whose turn is it?”) so GameEngine stays readable.
 * - Encapsulates the logic for advancing to the next player.
 *
 * @TODO (MVP):
 *       - getCurrentPlayer(): return state.players[state.currentPlayerIndex]
 *       - advanceTurn(): increment index and wrap around (mod player count)
 *
 * @TODO (optional later):
 *       - Methods for special rounds, steal-turn mechanics, etc.
